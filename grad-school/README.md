Graduate School
===============

When I was in 3A, I didn't know very much about graduate school. I had to figure
a lot of stuff out on my own -- I read blog posts and articles, applied for
research positions, and just last term, applied for graduate school. Now I'd
like to present what I've learned -- what I wish I knew in 3A. My presentation
is about 30 minutes long, and will be followed by a Q&A session with professors.

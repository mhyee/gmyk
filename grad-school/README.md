Graduate School
===============

When I was in third year, I didn't know very much about graduate school. I had
to figure a lot of stuff out on my own -- I read blog posts and articles, did
some research work with professors, applied for graduate school, and now,
finally, I'm a graduate student. In this presentation, I'd like to share what
I've learned -- what I wish I knew in third year. This presentation is about 30
minutes long.

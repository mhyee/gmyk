Give Me Your Knowledge
======================

This is simply a place for my informal talks/presentations.

The name "Give Me Your Knowledge" comes from the series of talks that were held
by the Software Engineering class of 2014 from the University of Waterloo.
I borrowed the name because these talks have the same spirit: sharing knowledge
on content not typically taught in classes, practising public
speaking skills, being informal, and having some fun.

Talks and abstracts are below.

Graduate School
---------------

When I was in 3A, I didn't know very much about graduate school. I had to figure
a lot of stuff out on my own -- I read blog posts and articles, applied for
research positions, and just last term, applied for graduate school. Now I'd
like to present what I've learned -- what I wish I knew in 3A. My presentation
is about 30 minutes long, and will be followed by a Q&A session with professors.

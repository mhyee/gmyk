Give Me Your Knowledge
======================

This is simply a place for my informal talks/presentations.

The name "Give Me Your Knowledge" comes from the series of talks that were held
by the Software Engineering class of 2014 from the University of Waterloo.
I borrowed the name because these talks have the same spirit: sharing knowledge
on content not typically taught in classes, practising public
speaking skills, being informal, and having some fun.

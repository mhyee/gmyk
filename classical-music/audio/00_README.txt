commentary if needed.

## Introduction

(01) Divertimento in D Major, K. 136. (W. A. Mozart)

## Baroque Period

Characteristics: complexity, ornamentation, multiple voices, long phrases,
basso continuo, harpsichord.

(02) Cello Suite No. 1 in G Major, BWV 1007. (J. S. Bach)

(03a) Mvt. I, Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 in G Major, BWV 1048. (J. S. Bach)

  This is from the harpsichord solo at the end of the movement. The harpsichord
  is a keyboard instrument (like the piano), but it plucks the strings.

(03b) Mvt. I, Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 in G Major, BWV 1048. (J. S. Bach)

  Note the long phrasing and the harpsichord playing the basso continuo.

(04) "Rejoice greatly" from Messiah, HWV 56. (G. F. Handel)

  Again, the basso continuo is played by the harpsichord. Pay attention to the
  complexity and ornamentation of the phrasing, and the contrast between the
  loud and quiet parts.

(05a) Mvt. III, Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 in F Major, BWV 1047. (J. S. Bach)

  Again, we hear the harpsichord basso continuo and the long, complex phrase.

(05b) Chaconne from Partita for Violin No. 2, BWV 1004. (J. S. Bach)

  Only one violin is playing, but the phrasing is still long, and the violinist
  plays multiple notes simultaneously, with a technique called double stops.

## Classical Period

Characteristics: periodic melodies with light accompaniment, clear, refined,
elegant, natural, easy to understand.

(06) Overture from The Marriage of Figaro, K. 492. (W. A. Mozart)

(07a) Theme from Piano Concerto No. 26 in D Major, K. 537. (W. A. Mozart)

  Played on the fortepiano, a precursor to the modern piano.

(07b) Theme from Piano Concerto No. 26 in D Major, K. 537. (W. A. Mozart)

  The same theme, but played on a modern piano. Compared to the fortepiano, the
  piano creates a gentler and richer sound that sustains.

(08a) Mvt. I, Symphony No. 94 in G Major, "Surprise," H. 1/94. (J. Haydn)

  Compared to complexity of Baroque pieces, notice how each note is clear and
  distinct.

(08b) Mvt. IV, String Quartet, Op. 33 No. 2, "The Joke." (J. Haydn)

  This piece tricks the audience into thinking it is over, but continues with
  multiple false endings, before restarting the main theme and then suddenly
  ending.

(09a) Theme, Variations on "Ah vous dirai-je, Maman," K. 265. (W. A. Mozart)

  An old French melody from the 18th century, still used today in "Twinkle,
  Twinkle Little Star."

(09b) Var. XII, Variations on "Ah vous dirai-je, Maman," K. 265. (W. A. Mozart)

  The twelfth and final variation on the theme. Even though it sounds complex
  and difficult, the main melody is still clearly heard.

(09c) Mvt. IV, Symphony No. 41 in C Major, "Jupiter," K. 551. (W. A. Mozart)

  The entire movement is built around the opening theme, which is just four
  notes. Again, note how clear the theme is, even as it is repeated with the
  full orchestra as accompaniment.

## Romantic Period

(10) Mvt. I, Symphony No. 5 in C minor, Op. 67. (L. van Beethoven)

Characteristics: individuality, originality, and expression of emotion.

(11a) Mvt. IV, Symphony No. 1 in C Major, Op. 21. (L. van Beethoven)

  This is from Beethoven's "early period," and is clearly influenced by
  Classical composers such as Haydn and Mozart.

(11b) Mvt. I, Symphony No. 3 in E♭ Major, "Eroica," Op. 55. (L. van Beethoven)

  This piece marks the beginning of Beethoven's "middle period," and is
  therefore a significant piece in the transition from the Classical to the
  Romantic period.

(11c) Mvt. IV, Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125. (L. van Beethoven)

  By this point, Beethoven was in his "late period" and was completely deaf.
  His late period works were far more complex, emotional, and introspective.
  For his Ninth Symphony, Beethoven brought in a choir, with the lyrics coming
  from Schiller's poem "Ode to Joy."

(12a) Gretchen at the Spinning Wheel, Op. 2, D. 118. (F. Schubert)

  This is a lied (German for "song"), which sets German lyrics to a piano
  accompaniment. Schubert wrote over 600 of these lieder. "Gretchen at the
  Spinning Wheel" is from the Faust story, and the piano represents the
  spinning wheel.

(12b) La campanella, from the Grand Etudes of Paganini, S. 141. (F. Liszt)

  La campanella (Italian for "the little bell") is a very difficult piano
  piece, based on Paganini's Violin Concerto No. 2. Liszt is considered one of
  the greatest pianists to have ever lived, and redefined what it meant to be a
  solo performer. In many ways, he was the original rock star.

(12c) Mvt. II, Violin Concerto in D Major, Op. 35. (P. I. Tchaikovsky)

  Tchaikovsky was the first Russian composer to become internationally popular.
  This was helped by his tours of Europe and America. Tchaikovsky was trained
  in the Western Europe style, but worked to combine that training with the
  traditional Russian style.

## 20th Century Music

### Impressionism?

Characteristics: detached observation, evokes a feeling, mood, atmosphere, or
scene.

(13a) Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun, L. 86. (C. Debussy)

  Based on the poem of the same name by Mallarmé. The poem is about a faun that
  has just woken from an afternoon nap, and wonders about the nymphs he may
  have dreamt about.

(13b) Piano Concerto in G Major. (M. Ravel)

  The piece opens with a whip crack. It is heavily influenced by jazz, yet
  still maintains the characteristics of impressionist music.

### Expressionism?

Characteristics: distortion of reality to evoke emotion, convey extreme and
irrational states of mind.

(14) Erwartung, Op. 17. (A. Schoenberg)

  This is an opera about a woman searching for her lover in a dark forest.
  Schoenberg himself describes it as "... the aim is to represent in slow
  motion everything that occurs during a single second of maximum spiritual
  excitement, stretching it out to half an hour."

## Avante-Garde?

(15a) Sonatas and Interludes. (J. Cage)

  This piece is played on a prepared piano, which is a piano that has been
  altered by placing objects onto or in between the strings.

(15b) 4′33″. (J. Cage)

  In this piece, performers are instructed to not play their instruments for
  four minutes and thirty-three seconds. The piece is not silence, but rather
  the sounds of the environment. John Cage was inspired when he visited an
  anechoic chamber and heard his heart beat, realizing that total silence did
  not exist. 4′33″ challenges the audience and asks: what is music?

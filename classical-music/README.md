A History of Classical Music
============================

What is classical music? How has it evolved over time? In this talk, I'll give a
tour of the last 400 years of classical music. We'll explore a selection of
composers, wander through different periods and styles, and of course, listen to
some music. No musical background is required for this talk. Whether you are
completely new to classical music, or have season tickets to the symphony, I
hope you will find something interesting in this talk.
